	-- If own_window is set, under X11 you can specify type of window conky displayed as:
	--
	--     normal mode makes conky show as normal window. This mode can be configured with use of own_window_hints setting.
	--     desktop windows are special windows that have no window decorations, are always visible on the desktop, do not appear in pager or taskbar, and are sticky across all workspaces. Many DEs include desktop windows for background, icons and desktop menu, in those cases it might be better to use normal or one of the below options, as those will cover conky when they're clicked on.
	--     dock windows reserve space on the desktop, i.e. WMs will try their best to not place windows on top of them. They're the same as desktop in other respects, but render on top of desktop windows.
	--     panel windows are similar to dock windows, but they also reserve space along a desktop edge (like taskbars), preventing maximized windows from overlapping them. The edge is chosen based on the alignment setting.
	--     utility windows are persistent utility windows (e.g. a palette or toolbox). They appear on top of other windows (in the same group), but otherwise behave much like normal windows.
	--     override windows are drawn directly on root window (desktop background) and are not under the control of the window manager. These will not work with DEs which draw desktop icons via custom panels/windows as those will cover conky. own_window_hints are ignored for override windows.
